% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,

n example of a reaction-diffusion equation with chaotic solutions. You can expect patterns to emerge from chaos. A uniformly discretization in space and periodic boundary conditions allows the Fast Fourier Transform to be used, so that when coupled with a suitable time stepping scheme a numerical method that suits the parallelism of OpenCL is obtained. The code was benchmarked on various CPU and GPU devices. Performance results for various problem sizes are shown. Example code can be found at:\\

\section{Introduction}
The Gray-Scott-equation\cite{grayscott} describes the reaction of 2 chemicals and it is given by 
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&= D_u\Delta u-uv^2+F(1-u),\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}&= D_v\Delta v+uv^2-(F+k)v.
\end{align*}
\vspace{-1.75mm}$~$\\
The equation is solved on $[-4\pi,4\pi]^2$ with periodic boundary conditions.
The parameters used in the simulations were $D_u=0.04$, $D_v=0.005$, $F=0.038$ and $k=0.076$. The initial data is a 2-dimensional Gaussian function in both components.

\section{Solving}
The equation is solved using a splitting method, in this case we split the equation into the non linear 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&=& -uv^2 ,\quad \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=uv^2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
and the linear part
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&=& D_u\Delta u+F(1-u), \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}&=& D_v\Delta v-(F+k)v. \\
 \end{eqnarray*} 
 %\vspace{-5}
 The linear part can be solved exactly in Fourierspace and the non linear could be exactly solved using the Lambert $W$ function, but there is no implementation available for OpenCl, instead fix point iteration is used to solve the implicit midpoint rule. The two parts are combined with Strang splitting\cite{splitting}. The space discretization is equidistant in both axes.

\subsection{Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize the data
\item Time stepping
\begin{enumerate}
\item Call non linear kernel
\item {\bf Compute FFT }\cite{clFFT}
\item Call linear kernel
\item {\bf Compute iFFT }
\item Call non linear kernel
\item Do some output
\end{enumerate}
\item Shut down the program
\end{enumerate}
The linear and non linear kernel operates on each grid point individually and are perfectly suit the parallelism of OpenCl. The most time consuming step is the computation of the FFT and iFFT. Also there is only data transfers from the GPU, when you do some output.



\section{Conclusions}
The results show that the GPU's outperform the CPU's in single precision, but when computing double precision the performance of the CPU's stays the same, while the GPU's have a significant drop. To compute the equation on larger grids or in 3-dimension, you will, have to face the problem that on GPU's memory is short. One could avoid that by writing a distributed FFT as the other kernels are independent on the problem size.
